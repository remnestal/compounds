# Compound words

[Compound formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)) is very common in the Swedish language and there are many combinations of words that can be reversed to form another correct word; sometimes with a completely different meaning. I have two friends who, for some reason, find this really exciting so I wanted to help them ❤️

But I don't like to think so I made this program to do that for me.

## Swedish dictionaries
All dictionaries are drawn from [Nordic Words](http://runeberg.org/words/) where they reside in the public domain as of **2018-03-22**.

Specifically, the following dictionaries are incorporated:
* [Svenska](http://runeberg.org/words/fr-svenska.txt) by _Projekt Runeberg_
* [ss100.txt](http://runeberg.org/words/ss100.txt) by _Lars Aronsson_
* [ord.niklas.frykholm](http://runeberg.org/words/ord.niklas.frykholm) by _Niklas Frykholm_
* [ord.swnet](http://runeberg.org/words/ord.swnet) by _swnet_

### Encoding
_ISO-8859-1_, which makes **åäö** behave a little weird in some contexts.
