# Compound words

[Compound formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)) is very common in the Swedish language and there are many combinations of words that can be reversed to form another correct word; sometimes with a completely different meaning. I have two friends who, for some reason, find this really exciting so I wanted to help them ❤️

But I don't like to think so I made this program to do that for me.
